suggestive, not prescriptive or combative (certain lists are bullies looking for \u000d\u000aa fight)\ufffd Ray Russell\u2019s list of Fifty Forgotten Books is the sort of genial com-","book reviews\u000d\u000a179\u000d\u000apilation that invites or challenges the reader \u2018to determine how many of \u000d\u000athese works they remember\u2019\ufffd In this convivial memoir of friendships and \u000d\u000aauthors, and the zig-zag of discoveries and enthusiasms, Russell chronicles \u000d\u000avanished bookshops and booksellers from Brighton to Wales to the north \u000d\u000aof England, visiting Holleyman and Treacher, Stone Trough Books, the \u000d\u000aGrimoire, The Lillies, George Locke and the wonderfully named Disjecta\ufffd \u000d\u000aIn his larval stage, in the 1980s, Russell was a teenage existentialist and \u000d\u000aaspiring musician who was given a paperback copy of Arthur Machen\u2019s \u000d\u000aThe Hill of Dreams (1907) by Mr Brookes who kept a bookshop in Brighton and was possibly ex-MI5 or MI6\ufffd Russell soon gravitated to the 1890s \u000d\u000aand the decadents, studied architecture at Sheffield, and made a pilgrimage \u000d\u000ato Providence to look at old buildings and H\ufffd P\ufffd Lovecraft manuscripts, \u000d\u000awhich only affirmed his interest in Machen\ufffd In 1988, Russell attended a \u000d\u000ameeting of the newly formed Arthur Machen Society and found a wider community of readers and fellow collectors\ufffd \u2018I met many friends who \u000d\u000ahelped to shape my reading and publishing life: Janet Machen (daughter \u000d\u000aof the author, quietly determined and generous), Mark Valentine (an erudite book lover and terrific writer), Roger Dobson (devotee of the overlooked author),\u2019 and others\ufffd Taking his cue from photocopy fanzine culture, Russell produced a Machen pamphlet, The Anatomy of Taverns, and \u000d\u000aTartarus Press was formed\ufffd\u000d\u000aAfter completing his architectural training, he found himself unable to \u000d\u000apractice in the field due to an economic downturn\ufffd One wouldn\u2019t usually \u000d\u000aconsider that that a two-year stint at a provincial vanity press would be the \u000d\u000asmithy where a career is forged, but Russell grasped the opportunity: \u2018I \u000d\u000aleft after two of the most traumatic years of my life, although I had learned \u000d\u000ahow to create proper hardback books, as opposed to booklets\ufffd\u2019 With this \u000d\u000atransformation, Tartarus Press (which he runs with his partner Rosalie \u000d\u000aParker), established itself as a distinguished specialist publisher of notable \u000d\u000areprints (Robert Aickman and Sarban among others) and significant new \u000d\u000aworks in the field of supernatural fiction\ufffd \u000d\u000aSeveral of the books and authors Russell takes as starting points for \u000d\u000aepisodes in his collecting memoir are not strictly forgotten (Le Grand \u000d\u000aMeaulnes, Lolly Willowes, or The Quest for Corvo), but they do serve as \u000d\u000amarkers along the way\ufffd Russell began reading Sylvia Townsend Warner \u000d\u000abecause of the Machen connection (she was his niece) and became a diligent collector of her work\ufffd By 1993 he envisioned a Warner society but \u000d\u000anot until 2000 did the stars align for its establishment\ufffd In the mid-1990s \u000d\u000aRussell began to compile and publish a Guide to First Edition Prices, which \u000d\u000awent through eight editions between 1997 and 2010, listing some 50,000 \u000d\u000atitles and more than 700 authors\ufffd Now is a moment of candour when I ","the book collector\u000d\u000a180\u000d\u000amust state that I have met Russell on several occasions: in conversation \u000d\u000aabout books or music, one can see the rigour and obsessive focus required \u000d\u000ato produce such a work\ufffd He was reviled in the TLS as \u2018Parsimonious Russell\u2019, and yet, he writes, \u2018for a decade, though, the Guides subsidised Tartarus Press, allowing me to publish and stay at home looking after our son \u000d\u000aTim, who was born in 1995\ufffd\u2019 I used to have one of those Guides, and it \u000d\u000amust now seem a relic like the Sears catalogue or the telephone book\ufffd \u000d\u000aA few old scores are rehashed in Fifty Forgotten Books, but with little rancour\ufffd Two early benefactors of literary societies are given anonymity: as \u000d\u000awith academia, the battles must have been so vicious because the stakes seem \u000d\u000aso trivial\ufffd After the implosion of the Arthur Machen Society, a new entity \u000d\u000awas organised, the Friends of Arthur Machen, which continues to this day\ufffd \u000d\u000aSome elements of this memoir will be familiar to readers of Russell\u2019s collection of essays, Past Lives of Old Books (2020), since he is chronicling many \u000d\u000aof the same interests and authors, but here the emphasis is on the friendships formed and colourful incidents and the telling of the tale is new\ufffd Russell writes succinctly of how he and Parker came to publish a few of their \u000d\u000aaward-winning bestsellers, including Rupetta by N\ufffd A\ufffd Sulway (2013) and \u000d\u000aThe Loney by Andrew Hurley (2014), noting wryly the massive publicity \u000d\u000awhich John Murray was able to throw at the latter when the firm reprinted \u000d\u000ait\ufffd There are portraits of the wily George Locke, the late Avalon Brantley, \u000d\u000aauthor Mark Valentine and other friends, and Russell writes movingly of \u000d\u000athe unexpected death of his friend Richard Dalby, who was a noted authority on ghost stories\ufffd Unsurprisingly for a publisher whose list includes \u000d\u000athe strange stories of Robert Aickman, there is an actual ghost story in these \u000d\u000apages, connected with the Tartarus collected ghost stories of Oliver Onion \u000d\u000aand Russell\u2019s eVorts to secure reprint permissions\ufffd It begins, \u2018As befits the \u000d\u000agranddaughter of an accomplished author of psychological ghost stories, \u000d\u000aJane Oliver was strangely elusive\ufffd\u2019 Fifty Forgotten Books includes a good list \u000d\u000aof books \u2013 no, you won\u2019t have read them all \u2013 and gives a very clear sense \u000d\u000aof Russell and Parker as part of a living community of writers, collectors \u000d\u000aand friends\ufffd It was a pleasure to spend a few hours in their company again\ufffd\u000d\u000aHazel Tubman\u000d\u000aspeaking volumes: books with histories\u000d\u000aBy David Pearson\u000d\u000a(Bodleian Library, 2022\ufffd ix, 230 pp\ufffd, illus, \u00a340)\u000d\u000aIn his Preface, David Pearson writes of \u2018a growing appreciation that there ","book reviews\u000d\u000a181\u000d\u000ais more to books than [text], that it is worth pausing to consider the packaging, because it has its own stories to tell\u2019\ufffd Undoubtedly Pearson himself \u000d\u000ahas much to do with this shift\ufffd His Books as History (London: The British \u000d\u000aLibrary & Oak Knoll Press, 2008) is now an essential introduction to the \u000d\u000aways in which the physical, and not solely textual properties of books can \u000d\u000aand should be read\ufffd Speaking Volumes: Books with Histories is a welcome \u000d\u000areturn to this theme\ufffd\u000d\u000aWhereas Books as History principally considered the \u2018before\u2019 of book \u000d\u000adesign and production, Speaking Volumes explores the \u2018after\u2019, namely the \u000d\u000aevidence left by \u2018the interaction of books with people, after they have been \u000d\u000acompleted\u2019\ufffd Each chapter examines diVerent kinds of evidence of book \u000d\u000aownership and use\ufffd After establishing the importance of the book as a \u000d\u000aphysical object in chapter one, chapter two considers marks of ownership; \u000d\u000achapter three, annotations; chapter four, additions and deletions; bindings \u000d\u000ain chapter five; and in chapter six, \u2018Accidents, incidents and talismans\u2019\ufffd In \u000d\u000athe seventh and final chapter, Pearson engages with the ongoing conversation surrounding the impact of technological change on the future of \u000d\u000abooks and libraries\ufffd\u000d\u000aPearson\u2019s writing is engaging, well-researched and a real pleasure to \u000d\u000aread\ufffd A great strength of this work is the dazzling array of supporting examples used\ufffd Each chapter contains four to six thoughtfully chosen case \u000d\u000astudies which allow their author a level of detail that can often, in studies \u000d\u000aof such breadth, be sacrificed in favour of brevity\ufffd Taking examples from \u000d\u000athe 9th to the 20th centuries, these focused analyses are by turns playful \u000d\u000aand poignant\ufffd It is through them that we meet the \u2018bombastic\u2019 Lee Warly, 18th-century lawyer and incorrigible book annotator; the enterprising \u000d\u000aElkanah Settle, who used armorial bindings to curry favour with prospective patrons; and tragic figures such as Thomas Howard, 4th Duke of \u000d\u000aNorfolk, who used his books as messengers on the eve of his execution and \u000d\u000a1960s book \u2018improvers\u2019 Kenneth Halliwell and Joe Orton\ufffd We are shown \u000d\u000abooks as witnesses of segregation in 20th-century Oklahoma and asked \u000d\u000ahow we should address traces of more negative forms of book \u2018use\u2019, such \u000d\u000aas vandalism\ufffd\u000d\u000aThe spectre of Silicon Valley (introduced on p\ufffd 7) is ever present here\ufffd \u000d\u000aThough there can be no doubt about Pearson\u2019s view of the digital \u2018steamroller coming up behind printed books and libraries\u2019, the final chapter is an \u000d\u000aeven-handed summary of the impact of digital advances upon individual \u000d\u000aand institutional attitudes to, and policies regarding, books\ufffd It is a good introduction to this thorny recent history, and Pearson\u2019s predictions for the \u000d\u000afuture of the book feel pragmatic rather than doom-mongering, weighing the cultural, technological and, above all, economic pressures that ","the book collector\u000d\u000a182\u000d\u000ahave driven the digital shift\ufffd Notably this final chapter contains only two \u000d\u000aimages, in marked contrast to the illustrations liberally deployed through \u000d\u000athe rest of the work\ufffd It is a quietly eVective demonstration of Pearson\u2019s \u000d\u000acentral thesis, and of what we risk losing by favouring electronic surrogates over their material counterparts\ufffd \u000d\u000aAny quibbles are negligible\ufffd Chapter six, \u2018Accidents, incidents and talismans\u2019, covers a great deal of ground and thus occasionally feels a little \u000d\u000amore thematically disjointed than its predecessors; but that matters little \u000d\u000awhen there are such enjoyable examples to be savoured\ufffd There is detail \u000d\u000ahere

djinn, has restored the ancient library to life by a series of miracles\ufffd First, in August 1996, \u000d\u000aEdinburgh electricians working on City Chambers lifted a disused hatch \u000d\u000aand found themselves in the backroom of a disused bookshop, its shelves \u000d\u000acontaining seventy-four ledgers of the firm of Bell & Bradfute, 1778\u2013\u000d\u000a1820s\ufffd Among them, Zachs found details of twenty-four books \u2018Bought \u000d\u000aat the Sale of Balcarres\u2019s Books\u2019 in May 1792, each numbered, suggesting a \u000d\u000acatalogue\ufffd Such a sale was indeed announced in the Edinburgh Evening Courant, but where was the catalogue? After a long search, one was found in \u000d\u000aa bound volume of catalogues belonging to the late Brian Lawn, whose \u000d\u000acollection, described by himself in The Book Collector in 1999, had been left \u000d\u000ato the Bodleian\ufffd It listed 1,260 items, and these, amplified with the contents \u000d\u000aof eight other book lists, mostly single sheets from diVerent inventories, \u000d\u000astill preserved in the Balcarres archives, have raised the total to 1,763 distinct bibliographical entities\ufffd Of these, it has to be said, quite a number are \u000d\u000aduplicates, caused by repetition of details of what must be the same book in ","book reviews\u000d\u000a183\u000d\u000athe catalogue or inventories\ufffd The printed sale catalogue, otherwise above \u000d\u000acontemporary standards, also included books from other sources added to \u000d\u000apad out the list of authentic books from Balcarres\ufffd\u000d\u000aIt remains, however, the staple of what is listed in this book, besides the \u000d\u000aeighty-seven books surviving at Balcarres\ufffd Some of these have never left \u000d\u000atheir ancestral home, but more have been retrieved by booksellers and \u000d\u000afriends of the family over the years, and as many more survive in other libraries in Scotland and elsewhere\ufffd The sum of these fully bear out the reputation of the Lindsay library as outstanding among those built up at that \u000d\u000atime\ufffd The father of the collection was David, Lord Lindsay of Edzell (1551\u2013\u000d\u000a1610), who, besides contemporary classical and theological literature, had \u000d\u000amarked interests in scientific and astronomical works, as well as astrology, \u000d\u000ametallurgy and magic\ufffd His more successful brother John Lindsay, Lord \u000d\u000aMenmuir (1553\u20131598), shared the same interests, as did his son, David, 1st \u000d\u000aLord Lindsay of Balcarres (1587\u20131641) and his son, Alexander, 1st Earl of \u000d\u000aBalcarres (1618\u20131659), although both suVered from the ruinous eVects of \u000d\u000acivil war\ufffd The real hero, and largest contributor to the library, was Colin, \u000d\u000a3rd Earl of Balcarres (1652\u20131722), who survived anxious straits of mainly \u000d\u000aJacobite public life to break the news of William III\u2019s supersession of James \u000d\u000aII to his monarch\ufffd Earl Colin, living longer than his predecessors, diVered \u000d\u000afrom them in having a greater interest in theology of all persuasions, in history and philosophy\ufffd He also seems to have been interested in earlier books, \u000d\u000aas witness his acquisition of Grolier\u2019s 1524 Plutarch, bound by Jean Picard, \u000d\u000awith multiple editions of favourite works, such as Lucretius\ufffd He took a \u000d\u000acatholic interest in church history, and clearly included Leibniz, Bayle and \u000d\u000aLe Clerc, Grotius and Gassendi, in his contemporary reading\ufffd At the same \u000d\u000atime, the manuscript \u2018Balcarres lute book\u2019 was acquired, perhaps under the \u000d\u000ainfluence of Earl Colin\u2019s fourth wife, Margaret\ufffd\u000d\u000aShe outlived her husband by over twenty years, and so, far from being neglected, the library\u2019s range was enlarged to take in poetry, drama \u000d\u000aand prose fiction in several languages, the subjects to include equitation, \u000d\u000agardening, cookery and even games\ufffd Nor was their appearance neglected, and a score or more books are now to be seen bound in 18th-century \u000d\u000abindings, contemporary with their texts or replacing or repairing earlier \u000d\u000abindings\ufffd The cataclysm that broke up the library was not due to neglect, \u000d\u000abut the decision of Alexander, 6th Earl of Balcarres, to concentrate on \u000d\u000ahis wife\u2019s Lancashire property, selling Balcarres to his brother Robert, \u000d\u000ajust returned a nabob from a successful career in India\ufffd It is clear that the \u000d\u000alibrary, old and now seeming antiquated, meant little to either brother\ufffd \u000d\u000aWhat has now been retrieved, really or virtually, has been raised before \u000d\u000aour eyes in this long catalogue\ufffd Some of the identifications, particularly ","the book collector\u000d\u000a184\u000d\u000aof books only known otherwise from imprecise inventories, may not be \u000d\u000aright, although the present cataloguers err on the side of caution in drawing on old and new catalogues (absence or presence in USTC, often cited, \u000d\u000ais uncertain evidence)\ufffd\u000d\u000aBut there is no doubt about the credit that is due to Bill Zachs as the \u000d\u000amastermind of this project, which has been crowned by the addition, only \u000d\u000arecently, of four more books hitherto lost to the library\ufffd Two came from \u000d\u000aBonham\u2019s sale of books from Aldourie Castle, Inverness, in 2002: the
